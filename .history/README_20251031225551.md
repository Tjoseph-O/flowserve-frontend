# FlowServe Frontend

Minimal React + Vite frontend for the FlowServe API challenge.

## What this includes
- Vite + React scaffold
- Simple navigation between Users and Transactions pages
- `src/services/api.js` - axios instance using `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Users page: list users with pagination and delete action
- Transactions page: simulate a transaction for a selected user

## Setup

1. Copy environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env to point to your backend, e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (Vite default) and use the app.

## API expectations
- GET /users?page=<n>&limit=<m> should return JSON: { users: [...], totalPages: n }
- DELETE /users/:id to delete a user
- POST /transactions/simulate with { userId, amount } to simulate a transaction; returns simulation result JSON

Adjust endpoints in `src/services/api.js` if your backend uses different shapes.

## Next steps I can take for you
- Add Create/Edit user forms and modals
- Add integration tests or Storybook
- Wire react-router-dom for URL routes
- Add Postman collection and example requests

If you'd like, I can now implement Create/Edit modals and wire simple tests. Request next action.
